Introduction
This repository provides a collection of Solidity smart contract examples to help developers understand and utilize various features of the language. Each .sol file demonstrates a different concept or functionality within Solidity, making it easier to learn and reference.

Smart Contracts
conditional.sol
This contract demonstrates the use of conditional statements (if, else if, else) in Solidity.

const.sol
This contract showcases the use of constants in Solidity, including how to declare and use constant state variables.

datatype.sol
This contract provides examples of different data types available in Solidity, including integers, booleans, strings, and more.

firstSC.sol
This is a simple "Hello, World!" contract to get you started with Solidity and smart contract development.

function.sol
This contract demonstrates the creation and use of functions in Solidity, including visibility, modifiers, and return values.

loop.sol
This contract illustrates the use of loops (for, while, do-while) in Solidity.

modifier.sol
This contract explains how to use function modifiers in Solidity to change the behavior of functions.

statevariable.sol
This contract covers the use of state variables in Solidity, including how to declare, read, and update them.

visibility.sol
This contract demonstrates the different visibility specifiers available in Solidity (public, private, internal, external) and how they affect the accessibility of functions and state variables.
